# The super project Bitcoin2Delphi for this conversion attempt is here:

https://github.com/SkybuckFlying/Bitcoin2Delphi

For now it is advised to simply clone the super project.

The/this delphicoin repository below will function as a collector to collect the converted delphi code ! =D

# Delphicoin

#### Bitcoin for Pascal/Delphi programming language !

This project converts the bitcoin c/c++ source code into Pascal/Delphi source code.

The aim of the project is to:

1. Convert all necessary bitcoin c/c++ source code to Pascal/Delphi for easier studieing of bitcoin's operation.
2. Work together with other Delphi/Pascal developers for fun and profit ! =D
3. Learn how to use GIT in bigger team effort and have fun with it.
4. Perhaps also learn a little bit more about C/C++ latest language features.
5. After conversion is done perhaps find ways to speed up bitcoin with delphi technology.

Requirements to take part in this project:

1. Must have a recent version of Delphi, for example Delphi 10.2 will do.
2. Anybody with pascal/delphi coding experience may join this project.
3. For now the workflow will be to fork this project or set upstream to it and issue pull request to incorporate your conversions into this main project.
4. The branch for the delphi conversion will be called: "Delphicoin" as a nickname for this project ! :)
5. It's ok to be messy everything helps ! =D
6. It is preferred to use tab characters for indentation. 
   In Delphi->Tools->Options:
   Use Tab Character Checked V
   Block Ident = 4
   Tab Stops = 4
   Cursor through tabs Checked V
   Optimal Fill Checked V
   Backspace unindents Checked V   
   
   Tip: With these settings enabled an easy but slower way to convert these spaces to tabs is to enable:
   Show tab character
   Show space character
   Then process the entire file by simply moving the cursor from top to bottom through the file with the down arrow on the keyboard.
   Another possibility is to use textpad editor and a plugin called "tabout"
