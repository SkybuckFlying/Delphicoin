# Delphicoin

#### Bitcoin for Pascal/Delphi programming language !

This project converts the bitcoin c/c++ source code into Pascal/Delphi source code.

The aim of the project is to:

1. Convert all necessary bitcoin c/c++ source code to Pascal/Delphi for easier studieing of bitcoin's operation.
2. Work together with other Delphi/Pascal developers for fun and profit ! =D
3. Learn how to use GIT in bigger team effort and have fun with it.
4. Perhaps also learn a little bit more about C/C++ latest language features.
5. After conversion is done perhaps find ways to speed up bitcoin with delphi technology.

Requirements to take part in this project:

1. Must have a recent version of Delphi, for example Delphi 10.2 will do.
2. Anybody with pascal/delphi coding experience may join this project.
3. For now the workflow will be to fork this project or set upstream to it and issue pull request to incorporate your conversions into this main project.
4. The branch for the delphi conversion will be called: "Delphicoin" as a nickname for this project ! :)
5. It's ok to be messy everything helps ! =D
